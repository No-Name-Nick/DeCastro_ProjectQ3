		<h3>What are we advocating for?</h3>
		<p>	We advocate for protecting human rights and fighting give it to people who don't have it. We go to countries where people are giving less than human rights and advocate through many different facets.</p>
		<p>Our secondary goal is to inform people about kidnapping, how to avoid it and what you should generally do if your friends, family or acqueintances go missing.</p>
		<h3>How did we start?</h3>
		<p>We started as a group of friends who wanted to help and around our area and so we started to advocate every way we could and people helped us through donations, spreading information about us and joining and contributing.</p>
		<p>Eventually we just started an organization to more efficiently acheive our goals. Then it grew and we were very suprised and happy that our small cause inspired so many people. We then got serious and now we're back to the present.</p>
