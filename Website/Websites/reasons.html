		<h3>Why we chose the advocacy?</h3>
		<p>We wanted to defend human rights because we once had a research project to research it and then we were truly touched by the atrocities that were comitted because of the lack of human rights. We also had one of our family members kidnapped which is why it's a secondary advocacy.</p>
		<p>Kidnapping has also just been one of our weird focus and we decided to channel our passion for the subject as force of good for people.</p>
		<h3>Why/How can I help?</h3>
		<p>You should help because of the this advocay has a lot of competent and reliable people. It's goals aren't unreachable but are also ambitious.</p>
		<p>You can help by donating to our website, contacting us to help physically and just taking the time to inform yourself and people you know.</p>
